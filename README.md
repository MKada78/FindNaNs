# FindNaNs
Python script to find NaNs for all the variables contained in a dataframe.
This script will also give you some stats about the frequency of these NaNs.

The purpose of this script is to help you analyse NaNs in a dataframe. 
This will help you decide how to deal with these NaNs based on their frequency.

## Files in my repository:
- Python_Find_NaNs_V10.py

### Prerequisites
- Python (I use version 3.7.2)
- An IDE for Python (I use Jupyter Notebook but you can use any other IDE or code editor).

### To run the MaxLength function :
1- Copy and paste the function in your code editor.
2- Call the function with one argument which is the name of the dataframe you wish to analyse (exp : find_nan(my_df)
3- You're done ! A table will be displayed providing you with the information mentioned in the first section of this Readme file.
